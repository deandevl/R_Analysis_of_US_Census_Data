# R_Analysis_of_US_Census_Data
Repository contains R scripts and html files that follows the book [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/) by Kyle Walker with R scripts in acquisition, wrangling, and ggplot2 based plotting. Functions from the R package [RcensusPkg](https://github.com/deandevl/RcensusPkg) are extensively used in performing the book's presentations.
